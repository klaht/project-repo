WeekScheduler is a desktop app that is used to visualize your weekly schedule. It is a mixup of a todo-list and a schedule, meaning instead
of adding tasks for specific time slots, you arrange them similarly to a todo list.

The application can be for example useful for students that may want to organize their work for every day of the week and keeping track of different assignments in the form of a todo-list.
